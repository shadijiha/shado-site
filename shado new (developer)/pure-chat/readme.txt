Never miss a lead
[Capture leads](https://www.purechat.com/convert-leads-live-chat-software "Capture leads") day and night by converting your chat box to a website form when your team is offline.

Our [website visitor tracking](https://www.purechat.com/website-visitor-tracking "website visitor tracking") allows you to see a list of details about your active website visitors and identify your best leads. See key information like a visitor’s name, country, time on site, current page, number of visits and source. You can also find out which pages they’ve viewed, and look up past interactions with returning shoppers or customers..
